#About

The Pivotal [Push Notification Service](https://network.pivotal.io/products/push-notification-service) for [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) allows developers to create a mobile backend that can be used to send push notifications to mobile apps.  The service connects and manages the interface to Apple Push Notification Service, Google Cloud Messaging, Microsoft Push Notification Service, Windows Push Notification Services and BlackBerry Push Service.

Each mobile app communicates with the service for registrations and notification preferences by using the corresponding client SDK. Back-end business logic servers send push notifications to all users, users by platform, users by geolocation, or users with specified tags by sending the request to the appropriate Push Notification Service API endpoint.

For installation, a PCF Administrator initially imports the Pivotal Push Notifications package into Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager and configures it via the Dashboard at which point the service becomes available to send notifications. The Dashboard provides the ability to configure apps, environments and device-specific service parameters. Client SDKs for iOS and Android provide a simplified way to integrate with the Push Notifications service.  Windows Phone 8, Windows 8 and Blackberry 10 apps can also use the service.

The Push Notifications service requires:
- Pivotal RabbitMQ
- Redis database (Pivotal Redis or user provided)
- MySQL database (Pivotal MySQL or user provided).
